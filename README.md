# For this assigment, I had to create a website using Bootstrap, which means making my page responsive.
I started by making a new repository and then pushing the basic structure of the web (index.html, contact.html, etc)
I made a fixed navbar, a fixed footer, and created a grid using columns and rows.
I added social media links to my footer.
I chose a picture for my background in my index.
When I worked in my portfolio, I added some of my prework, with images and links, following the grid layout.
For my contact page, I created a form.
And I added some of my own style.
